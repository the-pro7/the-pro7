## How long have I been doing this!? 🤔😎
Lemme break down my coding journey for you with this:
- **2021** (13 years old): Started learning HTML and CSS from YouTube and begun building small projects!
- **2022** (14 years old): Kicked some JavaScript into my memory and started making my projects functional! Also learned `git`, Markdown, and GitHub and threw my projects onto GitHub!
- **2023** (15 years old): Took my curiosity to the next level and learned React.js, which I used to develop my school's website with a bro! Also learned some backend with Node.js, Express
  , and MongoDB and built some amazing APIs (Personal ones though) and apps with the MERN tech stack!
- **This year** (16 years old): Found out that React.js was hiding a big brother (Next.js) and learned that one too. Didn't end there, I collaborated with a tech genius [Vitalik Hakim](https://github.com/Vitalik-Hakim) at Superate HQ and built him a platform for him!
