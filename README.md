## How long have I been doing this!? 🤔😎
Lemme break down my coding journey for you with this:
- **2021** (13 years old): Started learning HTML and CSS from YouTube and began building small projects!
- **2022** (14 years old): Kicked some JavaScript into my memory and started making my projects functional! Also learned `git`, Markdown, and GitHub and threw my projects onto GitHub!
- **2023** (15 years old): Took my curiosity to the next level and learned React.js, which I used to develop my school's website with a bro! Also learned some backend with Node.js, Express
  , and MongoDB and built some amazing APIs (Personal ones though) and apps with the MERN tech stack!
- **2024** (16 years old): Found out that React.js was hiding a big brother (Next.js) and learned that one too. Didn't end there, I collaborated with a tech genius [Vitalik Hakim](https://github.com/Vitalik-Hakim) at Superate HQ and built him a platform for him!
-  **This year** (Still waiting for birthday): About to do even crazier stuff but high school's kinda getting in the way! But no sweating I'm coming with awesome stuff this year!
    Just looking forward to learn more, do more and be more!
